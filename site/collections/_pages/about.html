      <h3>Approach to Data Science</h3><p>My name is Zak and I'm not afraid to
      say I'm a data science nerd. However, just because I don't mind getting my
      hands dirty and getting lost in some code doesn't mean that's where my
      passions lie. In fact, I am most passionate about the intersection of data
      science and business strategy. I believe that data science is a tool that
      can be used to help companies operate more efficiently, make better
      decisions, and uncover unique insights. This belief is the product of a
      variety of different positions across many functional
      areas.&nbsp;</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>I'm a self trained data scientist who
      started my career in finance. I've spent time in excel spreadsheets, word
      documents, and powerpoints as well as identifying, developing and testing
      hypotheses. I've built models ranging in complexity. I've deployed models
      to the cloud, although, I will admit I am more comfortable leaving this
      step to the machine learning engineers. Below is a list of skills I have
      mastered</p><ul><li><strong>Supervised Learning:
      </strong><em>Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient
      Boosting, XGBoost, KNN, Naive Bayes </em></li><li><strong>Unsupervised
      Learning: </strong><em>Hierarchical and K-Means clustering,
      PCA</em></li><li><strong>Deep Learning: </strong><em>Neural Networks,
      Tensor Flow, Keras </em></li><li><strong>Programming: </strong><em>Java,
      Python, SQL, MATLAB, and familiar with: C/C++, MPI
      </em></li><li><strong>Cloud Computing: </strong><em>AWS,
      Azure</em></li></ul><p>Just because I've turned 30, doesn't mean I need to
      stop learning, right? I'm purusing a Master's degree in Computer Science
      and Information Technology from the University of Pennsylvania - partly
      because I love to learn and partly because I recognized holes in my self
      taught data science skill set. This degree gives me the chance to
      formalize my knowledge of both computers and machine learning concepts.
      Fight on, Pennsylvania!</p><h3>Fun Fact</h3><p>I'm based in San Diego, CA.
      I'm a coffee-drinking, golf-playing, early-to-bed kind of guy. I thrive
      outside of my comfort zone. I enjoy a nice routine, but am not afraid to
      break it. My love for numbers goes beyond the desk - check out my
      Instagram for a complete rating of burgers, salads and lobster
      rolls.&nbsp;</p>
