title: Async Programming for Data Scientists
description: >-
  Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a
  potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other
  events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has
  finished.

Asynchronous programming is a powerful technique that allows developers to write more efficient and responsive applications. By executing multiple tasks concurrently, asynchronous programming can help improve the performance of your code, especially when dealing with I/O-bound tasks such as network requests or database queries.

While asynchronous programming has been around for a long time, it has become more popular in recent years as more developers have embraced its benefits. Asynchronous programming is supported in many programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Java, among others.

In this post, we will explore the basics of asynchronous programming, including:

* Differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming&nbsp;
* Use of coroutines and event loops, and the
* Benefits and drawbacks of asynchronous programming.
* Using asynchronous programming as a data scientist
* Asynchronous Programming outside of data science
