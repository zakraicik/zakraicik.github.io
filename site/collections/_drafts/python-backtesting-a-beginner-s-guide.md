# Python Backtesting: A Beginner's Guide

In my [last post](https://zakraicik.xyz/blog/cyrpto-prices-in-python){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I wrote about to use the [Binance](https://www.binance.us/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} API to pull historical prices for various Crypto assets. In this article, we will lay the foundation for&nbsp;**simple** backtester. A backtester is a software tool that allows traders and investors to simulate the performance of their trading strategies using historical market data. By applying a set of rules to the historical data, a backtester can provide valuable insights into how a strategy would have performed in the past, helping traders make more informed decisions in the future.

Specifically, this article covers.&nbsp;

* Homegrown backtester vs. pre-built backtester
* Reviewing the format of our historical price data
* Simulating buy/sell signals using various strategies
* Next Steps

The full repository can be found [here](https://github.com/zakraicik/crypto_trader/tree/main/crypto_trader){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Keep in mind this article covers one part of a bigger project.&nbsp;

## Homegrown or Pre-built?

---

There are a lot of prebuilt backtesters available in Python already including Backtrader, PyAlgoTrade, Zipline, and Catalyst. Knowing that so many backtesters are already built, why would we build our own?&nbsp;

### **Customization**

First, when constructing your backtester, you have the opportunity to handpick the features that are most relevant to your investment approach. This means you can include elements such as custom trading signals, advanced risk management options, and various asset classes, allowing for a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis.

Additionally, by developing your own backtester, you can integrate multiple data sources, ensuring that your model has access to the most relevant and up-to-date information. This allows for more accurate backtesting, which can lead to better decision-making when it comes to implementing your strategies in the real world.

Another advantage of having a custom-built backtester is the ability to incorporate your own unique algorithms and trading strategies. This can be especially valuable for quantitative traders who require highly specialized tools to execute their complex models. A tailored backtester can accommodate these advanced strategies and test them with precision, offering insights that may not be possible with off-the-shelf software.

### **Flexibility**

Modifying and adapting your custom-built backtester as your trading strategies evolve is a powerful advantage that provides you with the ability to stay ahead in the ever-changing financial markets. This dynamic approach not only gives you greater flexibility and control over your investment decisions but also allows you to continually refine and improve your strategies, leading to enhanced performance and risk management.

One of the primary benefits of having an adaptable backtester is that it enables you to incorporate new data sources, analytical techniques, and market insights as they become available. Financial markets are constantly evolving, with new information and trends emerging regularly. An adaptable backtester ensures that you can seamlessly integrate these changes, ensuring that your trading strategies remain up-to-date and relevant.

Furthermore, as you gain experience and insights from trading, you may develop new ideas or hypotheses about market behavior that you want to test. With a customizable backtester, you can quickly and easily incorporate these new concepts and test their effectiveness. This ability to experiment and iterate on your trading strategies can lead to the discovery of profitable opportunities that might have otherwise been overlooked.

### **Cost**&nbsp;

Building your own backtester can indeed be a more cost-effective solution in the long run as compared to using pre-existing or subscription-based backtesting software. This advantage becomes even more significant when you plan on utilizing the backtester over an extended period of time or have specialized needs that may require frequent updates or customizations.

There are several reasons why creating your own backtester can be more economical in the long run:

1. **Initial investment:** While developing your own backtester may require an upfront investment in terms of time and resources, this cost is typically a one-time expense. On the other hand, pre-existing solutions often come with ongoing subscription fees or recurring charges, which can add up significantly over time.
2. **Customization costs:** Pre-existing backtesting platforms may charge additional fees for customizations or advanced features. Building your own backtester allows you to include these features from the outset, without incurring extra expenses. Furthermore, as your needs evolve, you can implement modifications yourself, avoiding costly updates or service charges from third-party providers.
3. **Scalability:** A custom-built backtester is designed specifically to accommodate your unique trading strategies and requirements. As your trading volume or complexity increases, your backtester can be scaled up accordingly, without the need for costly upgrades or additional subscriptions that might be necessary with pre-existing solutions.
4. **Independence:** By developing your own backtester, you become self-sufficient and are not reliant on the continued support or availability of a third-party platform. This can help you avoid unexpected disruptions, such as a platform shutting down or experiencing technical issues, which could result in additional costs or delays in your trading activities.
5. **Intellectual property:** When you create your own backtester, you retain full ownership of the software and its underlying algorithms, giving you the freedom to use, modify, or even sell the system as you see fit. In contrast, pre-existing solutions often come with licensing restrictions or usage limitations that could constrain your flexibility and potentially generate additional expenses in the future.

### **Learning**

Building your own backtester is an invaluable learning experience that can significantly deepen your understanding of how backtesting systems work, as well as the underlying mechanics of trading strategies and financial markets. By undertaking the development process yourself, you gain hands-on experience and insight into the intricacies of backtesting, which can ultimately lead to better trading decisions and improved investment performance.

Here are several ways that constructing your own backtester enhances your learning:

1. **Understanding the data:** In order to create an effective backtester, you need to be well-versed in handling various types of market data, such as historical price, volume, and fundamental information. This process helps you develop a deeper appreciation of data quality, data cleaning, and data management techniques, all of which are crucial in generating accurate backtesting results.
2. **Developing trading algorithms:** Building a backtester requires you to translate your trading ideas into specific rules and algorithms. This step not only helps you refine and clarify your strategies but also teaches you about the challenges and limitations associated with algorithmic trading, such as overfitting, curve-fitting, and lookahead bias.
3. **Implementing risk management:** An integral aspect of creating a backtester is incorporating risk management strategies to evaluate and control the potential losses in your trading systems. By designing these mechanisms yourself, you gain a better understanding of the importance of risk management and the various methods used to mitigate risk, such as position sizing, stop-loss orders, and diversification.
4. **Evaluating performance:** A well-designed backtester includes various performance metrics to assess the effectiveness of your trading strategies. By implementing these metrics, you can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of your strategies and learn how to interpret and analyze these results to improve your trading decisions.
5. **Simulation and optimization:** Building your own backtester enables you to experiment with different market conditions, parameter values, and timeframes. This hands-on experience allows you to learn about the robustness of your trading strategies, the importance of out-of-sample testing, and the dangers of over-optimization.
6. **Debugging and troubleshooting:** Developing a backtester often involves encountering and solving various issues related to coding, logic, or data. Troubleshooting these problems not only enhances your programming skills but also helps you learn about the common pitfalls and challenges associated with backtesting.
