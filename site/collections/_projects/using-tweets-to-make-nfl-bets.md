# ​​​​​​**Hypothesis**

Every week, I browse twitter and I notice a few hot takes related to NFL games. Take for example, this person predicting the 5-1 New York Giants will lose to the 2-3 Jacksonville Jaguars. This seems unlikely given the records, but who knows?

In fact, every week millions of people around the world take to twitter to share their thoughts about upcoming NFL games. I always wonder, are these tweets related to how teams will perform? Can they help me predict winners and losers each week?&nbsp;

To be more specific, we will test the relationship between NFL tweets and betting odds. **In other words, are tweets correlated with betting odds?**

# **Path to Testing Hypothesis&nbsp;**

*This plan will most likely change as I work to test the hypothesis. I will keep the plan up to date.&nbsp;*

1. *Downloading Tweets Related to the NFL:&nbsp;*We will develop a dataset of tweets all related to the NFL.&nbsp;
2. *Isolating Relevant Tweets:&nbsp;*Only a subset of tweets will actually be usable for our purpose. It's likely that many of the tweets we download are purely for marketing or redirect users elsewhere. We want to isolate tweets where the author expresses views about a specific NFL game/team.&nbsp;
3. *Quantifying some type of Tweet Sentiment:&nbsp;*Once we have isolated the tweets we want, we need to estimate wether that tweet speaks positively or negatively about the NFL game/team. Does the author believe the team will win or lose?&nbsp;
4. *Comparing Sentiment to Game Odds:* Is there a relationship between tweet sentiment and game odds? Do games with higher average sentiment correlate with games with larger odds (odds suggesting bigger win margins)?&nbsp;
